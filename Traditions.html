                The Syriac and Assyrian people celebrate three different holidays, Christmas, Easter and Kha b-Nisan which is the Assyrian new year. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong><u>Christmas:</u></strong>
                <br>
                
                They celebrate Christmas on the 25th, unlike Sweden where they celebrate Christmas on the 24th. When they celebrate Christmas, they are celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ and itâ€™s a happy and joyful day where you are meant to be happy and enjoy life. In the room where you celebrate, you have a beautiful Christmas tree filled with colorful lights, Christmas balls, small white angels, gold banderole and on the tip of the Christmas tree you have a shining gold star that catches your attention immediately. When celebrating Christmas you meet up with your family and eat dinner together, you give each other presents, play games together, show your love to each other and most importantly you are making sure you are having a good time.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong><u>Easter:</u></strong>
                <br>
                Assyrians and Syriacs follow a different calendar, from the rest of the world. The calendar that the rest of the world follows says that Easter should be celebrated on a Sunday each year, while Assyrians and Syriacs celebrate Easter on different days. One year they celebrate on the same date as the rest of the world and the next year, they celebrate one month after the rest of the world. The two next years they celebrate one week after the rest of the world. Afterward, this loops around. When they celebrate Easter they celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ and they do it the same way as Christmas except for the part where you give each other presents. Instead, you give each other big plastic eggs full of delicious candy and chocolate.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong><u>Kha b-Nisan:</u></strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Kha b-Nisan is celebrated on April the first and it is celebrated the same way the rest of the world celebrates the new year, on December the 31st. The Assyrians celebrate it on April the first because they started counting their calendar days on April the first. The Assyrian people also started counting their days long before the rest of the world. They are actually in the year 6 761. When you celebrate Kha b-Nisan, just like the new year it is a happy day where you spend time with your friends and family, whom you love. You fire fireworks up to the sky and watch them explode into different shapes, sizes, colorful colors and some fireworks can even explode into a text. For example, you can light up the dark and beautiful sky with a firework that shoots out a beautiful gold color, which says, happy new year.
